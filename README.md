# Birthday Countdown
This was one of my earliest exposure to JavaScript. This is probably as vanilla as it can get. I never intended to make this public, but since this shows the "old-ways" of doing things I thought of preserving it here.

My birthday is on *22nd of August*. It shows a count down to the date. On my birthday, it shows a birthday wish instead of the countdown.  Pretty narcissistic, amirite? :3
